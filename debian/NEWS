freeipmi (1.6.3-1.1ubuntu1) eoan; urgency=low

  The use of RUN=yes|no in /etc/default configuration files is deprecated.
  Speficically, this setting was removed from /etc/default/bmc-watchdog and,
  since it was the only setting in /etc/default/ipmidetectd, that file was
  removed entirely.
  Please use systemctl enable|disable to control whether each service should
  start or not.
  .
  Since 1.4.11-1.1ubuntu2 and 1.4.11-1.1ubuntu3, Ubuntu has been carrying two
  patches to enable IPv6 in IPMI discovery and IPMI power. These patches were
  eventually accepted upstream, and released in the 1.6.x series, but with two
  symbols renamed to a singular form:
  - ipmi_cmd_get_lan_configuration_parameters_ipv6_dynamic_addresses became
    ipmi_cmd_get_lan_configuration_parameters_ipv6_dynamic_address
  - tmpl_cmd_get_lan_configuration_parameters_ipv6_dynamic_addresses_rs became
    tmpl_cmd_get_lan_configuration_parameters_ipv6_dynamic_address_rs
  Ubuntu has now dropped the patches, which means the plural form of these
  symbols are no longer available. We checked as best as we could and it looks
  like nothing in the archive ever used them.
  If, after this update, you get errors regarding these symbols, please open
  a bug on the freeipmi package at the following address:

freeipmi (1.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Config files were moved under /etc/freeipmi.  Legacy location (under
    /etc) is supported only for backwards compatibility.  Please migrate
    your changes and remove configuration files from legacy locations.
  * ipmimonitoring tool was removed -- superseded by ipmi-sensors
    and the new --output-sensor-state option (thin wrapper
    /usr/sbin/ipmimonitoring is provided)

freeipmi (0.8.10-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Upstream has switched from CVS to SVN.  Since target SVN seemed to lack any
  history of merging, I had decided to revert to classical way to package for
  Debian based on tarballs.  Thus do not expect complete development history
  upon checkout.  As a consequence I  have abandoned any previous history of
  Debian packaging, and recreated Debian packaging repository use
  git-import-dscs --debsnap.  Please remove any previous debcheckout of
  freeipmi you might have.

  To stay consistent with upstream, following init.d/default/logrotate.d
  files for freeipmi-bmc-watchdog were renamed accordingly (with handling
  of renames done by dpkg-maintscript-helper mv_conffile in debhelper
  scripts).
  Please verify that your changes to corresponding files were preserved.
